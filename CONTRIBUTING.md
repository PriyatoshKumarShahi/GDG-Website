## Coding Style

We aim to keep our code clean and consistent:

* **HTML:**

  * Use semantic elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, etc.) where possible.
  * Keep indentation at **2 spaces**.
* **CSS:**

  * Use **kebab-case** for class names (`.nav-bar`, `.main-container`).
  * Group related properties (e.g., positioning, then box-model, then typography).
  * Prefer flexbox or grid for layout instead of floats.
* **General:**

  * Write self-explanatory code.
  * Add comments only when something isnâ€™t obvious.
